# Website Parser

This code is written for parsing the search results page of a website, **https://index.hu/** (a Hungarian news portal).
It can separate URLs related to a search keyword, and can extract relevant information, such as author name,
title, content and publishing date.

An ElasticSearch connector is also included, using high-level client.
